# Sales Data Analysis with Python

## Project Overview

Here, I developed a comprehensive python project on sales data analysis. This process involved several stages, including cleaning data using pandas, answering different business questions regarding the sales data of 48 months from January 2011 to December 2014, and visualising data with python libraries - matplotlib and seaborn. This sales dataset contains 51290 records, and 21 columns. 

## Dataset Used

## Business Questions
We have to answer these five questions through our data analysis mainly using pandas and matplotlib library.

- Q1. What is the overall sales trend?
- Q2. Which are the Top 10 products by sales?
- Q3. Which are the Most Selling Products?
- Q4. Which is the most preferred Ship Mode?
- Q5. Which are the Most Profitable Category and Sub-Category?

## Process
 We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:
- Check data for any missing values, duplicate values, outliers and anomalies, and handle the issues.
- Make sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data types, data format and values used. 
- Removing rows based on a condition
- Change the data type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype) if necessary.

Once we have cleaned up our data, we move the data exploration section. In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data which have been mentioned above.

To answer these questions we walk through python pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:

- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str) 
- Using the .apply() method
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualise our results
- Labeling our graphs
