# Sales Data Analysis with Python

## Project Overview

Here, I developed a comprehensive python project on sales data analysis. This process involved several stages, including cleaning data using pandas, answering different business questions regarding the sales data of 48 months, and visualising data with python libraries - matplotlib and seaborn. This sales dataset contains 51290 records, and 21 columns. 

## Dataset Used


## Business Questions
We have to answer these five questions through our data analysis mainly using pandas and matplotlib library.

- Q1. What is the overall sales trend?
- Q2. Which are the Top 10 products by sales?
- Q3. Which are the Most Selling Products?
- Q4. Which is the most preferred Ship Mode?
- Q5. Which are the Most Profitable Category and Sub-Category?
